# Nexora Investments - Facebook Post Error Analysis

## ❌ Error Found

When trying to post to the **Nexora Investments** Facebook page, the following error occurs:

```
(#200) The permission(s) publish_actions are not available. 
It has been deprecated. If you want to provide a way for your app users 
to share content to Facebook, we encourage you to use our Sharing products instead.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

Your Facebook access token is trying to use the deprecated `publish_actions` permission. Facebook removed this permission in 2018 and replaced it with more specific scopes for different types of posts.

## ✅ Solutions

### Option 1: Update the Access Token (Recommended)
Your access token in [visa.py](visa.py#L5) needs to be refreshed with the correct permissions:

1. Go to [Facebook Graph Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer)
2. Select your app and generate a new access token with these permissions:
   - `pages_read_engagement`
   - `pages_manage_metadata`
   - `pages_manage_posts`
3. Set the new token in your `.env` file:
   `FB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_new_token_here`

### Option 2: Use the Instagram API Instead
If you want to post photos with captions, use Instagram Graph API:
```python
# Instead of /photos endpoint, use:
# POST /me/media (create media)
# POST /me/media_publish (publish media)
```

### Option 3: Switch to the `/feed` Endpoint
Update the API endpoint to use the `/feed` endpoint instead of `/photos`:
```python
# Change from:
FB_API_URL = f"https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/{PAGE_ID}/photos"

# To:
FB_API_URL = f"https://graph.facebook.com/v19.0/{PAGE_ID}/feed"
```

## 📋 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Generate a new access token from Facebook Graph Explorer
- [ ] Ensure it has: `pages_manage_posts` permission
- [ ] Update `FB_ACCESS_TOKEN` in `.env`

## 🔧 Changes Made (Auto-Fix)

I've improved the error handling in both files:
- ✅ Better error messages from Facebook API
- ✅ Try-catch exception handling  
- ✅ Proper return values (False for failures)

The error messages will now clearly show the Facebook API error instead of just saying "Failed".
